## Welcome to SQL Data Agent! ðŸ¤–

Hi there! This is a SQL Data Agent to assist you in fetching data and related insights from an attached relational database.
The database available to the agent is the conventional power plants dataset from OPSD available [here](https://data.open-power-system-data.org/conventional_power_plants/).

The technologies used to set this agent up are [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app?hl=en-IN), [HuggingFace embedding models](https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-with-embeddings) of the SQL agent and [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/get-started/overview) for UI integration.
This is currently a PoC! Hence, it maybe sharp around the edges.
