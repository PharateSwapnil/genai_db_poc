## Welcome to SQL Data Agent! ðŸ¤–

Hi there! This is a SQL Data Agent to assist you in fetching data and related insights from an attached relational database. The databases available to the agent are the conventional power plants and time-series datasets from OPSD available [here](https://data.open-power-system-data.org/conventional_power_plants/).

The technologies used to set this agent up are [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app?hl=en-IN) and [HuggingFace embedding models](https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-with-embeddings) for the SQL agent, and [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/get-started/overview) for UI integration.


This is currently a PoC, it can be sharp around the edges.
